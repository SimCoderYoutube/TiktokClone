> Main repository of the SimCoder's youtube series &#34;Make an App like TIKTOK&#34;

Make a web app Like TIKTOK

I'll show you how you can do this in the simplest way and terms possible.

By the end of this series you'll have learned how the big companies do it and will be able to do the same, you not only will be able to do this app, but you'll be able to put what you learn into your very own projects!

Any question, ask me in the Forum, every question gets an answer! http://www.simcoder.com/forum

This project will be made using react native, firebase firestore, firebase storage, redux, expo, along with a lot of other packages and technologies which will help us get this TIKTOK clone app up and running as fast as possible.
